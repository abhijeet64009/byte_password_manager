<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23/11/2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Abhijeet Kumar</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles 
information when you use this mobile application (“the App”).
</p>

<p>
This App is designed to function completely offline and does not collect, store, or share 
personal data with any server, cloud service, or third party. All sensitive information saved 
by the user is stored locally on their device and protected using AES encryption.
</p>

<p>
If you use the App, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li>Share information with third parties</li>
    <li>Track your device, location, or usage</li>

</ul>

<h2>2. Sensitive Data You Store in the App</h2>

<p>
The App allows you to store information such as passwords, secure notes, card details, and
other private entries. All such data is:

    <li><strong>Encrypted locally</strong> using AES</li>
    <li><strong>Never uploaded</strong> to any cloud or server</li>
    <li><strong>Accessible only on your device</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
We cannot access, decrypt, or recover any information stored by you in the App.
</p>

<h2>3. Encryption and Security</h2>

<p>
All stored data is encrypted using industry-standard AES encryption methods. 
This ensures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only you can access your stored information</li>
    <li>Your data is never transmitted online</li>
    <li>Your information remains safe even if your device is offline</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you uninstall the App or delete its storage, all encrypted data is permanently erased.
</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>
The App may offer optional in-app purchases (subscriptions or one-time unlocks) to
access premium features. All payments are processed securely through Google Play Billing.
We do not process or store your payment details.
</p>

<h2>5. Exporting Data</h2>

<p>
The App allows you to export your stored passwords and data as an AES-encrypted JSON file. 
This exported file:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Remains encrypted</li>
    <li>Can only be decrypted inside the App</li>
    <li>Is not shared with us or any third party</li>
</ul>

<p>You are responsible for storing this exported file safely.</p>
